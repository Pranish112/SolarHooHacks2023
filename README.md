Important Notes:
1. No data is being saved in real time, this is just to showcase the concept and how it could possibly work.
2. The concept is about education and how we can help college students be more organized.
3. The website is divided into 2 segments, a timer that tells you when your next class is, and a schedule that you can access easily.
   Finally, you also have a checklist that you can keep adding onto, to remain organized, and remove it once you have completed the task.
   
On aspects of growth:
1. We plan to take this far beyond just times, schedules, and planners. We want to make Solar, an application that all students use for everything, from communication,
   to cross-checking their informations, and even plagerism.
2. In the future we hope to inbuild AI and ML to enhance the application so students can be saved from issues occuring from chatGPT, and other AI's.
3. Finally we hope to utilize this app to make this world a better place, and we will do this by providing quality education to countries in need,
   and make Solar a global app, that is the one stop destination for all college students. If possible, we would also love to explore sectors such as elimentary, middle, and high school entities.
